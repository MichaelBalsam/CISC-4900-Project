        <h2 class id="section3">Computer workflow</h2>

        <p class="TextStyle">The computer consists of multiple parts that when combined make 
          the computer function properly. These parts can be split up into four categories: input devices, 
          output devices, central processing unit, and the storage devices.</p>
  
          <p>The figure below represents the workflow of a computer system:</p>

          <img class="ImageStyle2" src="images/Computer Basics/Image4.jpg" alt="Computer WorkFlow"/>
          
          <h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">The central processing unit or CPU is the brain of the computer. 
          The main job of the CPU is to make sure the computer is functioning properly. It does 
          this by processing data fetching and executing information to pieces of the computer. 
          The CPU is comprised of three components the control unit, arithmetic logic unit, and memory.</p>
  
          <h4>CPU Components</h4>

          <li><b>The control unit</b> handles all processor control signals. It directs all input and output 
          flow, fetches code for instructions and controlling how data moves around the system. </li><br>
          <li><b>Arithmetic logic unit</b> or ALU is that part of the CPU that handles 
          all the calculations such as Addition, Subtraction, Comparisons that the CPU may need. Along with 
          the ALU also performs logical operations, and bit shifting operations. </li><br>
          <li><b>The memory unit</b> is in charge of storing the results that have been calculated 
          by the ALU and storing them back into the memory. A computer has two types of memory primary
          memory and secondary memory. Primary memory resides within the CPU whereas secondary memory is external to it.</li>

          <hr class="style">

        <h2 class id="section4">Memory</h2>

        <p class="TextStyle">Computer memory is a physical device that can either store information temporarily, 
        like RAM (random access memory) or permanently, like ROM (read only memory). These memory devices are used 
        by the operating system, software, and hardware of the computer. Memory can be of two type either primary or secondary.  </p>

        <h3>Volatile vs. non-volatile memory</h3>

        <p class="TextStyle">Memory can either be <b>volatile</b> or <b>non-volatile</b> memory.
        Volatile memory such as RAM is memory is also called temporary memory because the information 
        stored in the RAM is lost when the computer or device is powered off. Nonvolatile memory such as 
        ROM is permanent memory because the information stored in ROM is not lost when the computer is powered off. </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
          <h3>Primary Memory</h3>
          <p>Definition: Primary memory is the main memory of the computer system. Retrieving data from primary 
          memory is faster than secondary memory because it is the computers internal memory system. However, 
          Primary memory is volatile, and we be lost if not saved before a computer loss of power or shut off. </p>

            </ul>
          </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="column">
          <h3>Secondary Memory</h3>
          <p>Definition: Secondary memory is the opposite of primary memory. The secondary memory 
          is slower to access than primary memory. Along with that it can store more data than primary
          memory and it is non-volatile. This type of memory will not be deleted when the computer is powered off.  </p>

        <li><b>RAM:</b>The RAM or random-access memory is also a component that is contained on the motherboard. RAM is primary memory that 
        is volatile and is lost every time the computer losses power. However, while RAM is only temporary it is much faster 
        than secondary memory. </li> <br>

        <li><b>Expansion cards:</b> Most motherboards have something called an expansion slot. These explosion 
        slots can also be referred to as PCI or PCIe (peripheral component interconnect) and (peripheral 
        component interconnect express). The different types of expansion cards are video cards, sound cards, 
        and network cards and each card is cable of providing a performance boost to the computer. </li> <br>

        <li><b>Hard drive:</b> The hard drive is also located withing the PC tower.

        <h2 class id="section6">Software:</h2>

        <p class="TextStyle">Software: Software is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do and 
        how to function. Computer software accounts for programs and procedures of associated with the operations
        of a computer system. Software provides the instructions to allow hardware devices to function. There is 
        a verity of computer software however, there are two major categories system software, and application software.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
          <h3>System software</h3>
          <p>Definition: The system software acts as an interface between the hardware and the user. 
          This is because hardware and humans communicate in different languages. The software is responsible 
          for converting all human instructions into machine understandable instructions machine language.  </p>
            
          <li>Operating System</li>
          <li>Language Processor</li>

      </div>

      <h3>Operating System</h3>
        <p class="TextStlye"><b>Operating system:</b> The operating system is the first system that is loaded when
        the computer is powered on and is called the booting process. It manages all the software and hardware
        functions more specifically basic functions such as storing data in memory, retrieving files from storage 
        devices, scheduling tasks based on priority and more. There are several different operating systems but the 
        most common are windows OS and macOS.</p>

      <h3>Language Processor</h3>
        <p class="TextStlye"><b>Language processor:</b> The language processor is an important function of the system software. 
        It converts all human instructions into machine understandable instructions machine language.  </p>

        <h4>Types of computer language:</h4>

        <li><b>Machine level language:</b> The machine level language is also called low-level language is a series of 0’s
        and 1’s that a computer interpreters as instructions. That series of 1’s and 0’s is called binary code.</li><br>

        <li><b>Assembly Language:</b> The assembly language is a low-level programming language that’s main purpose is to 
        communicate directly with computer hardware. In addition to that assembly languages are designed to be readable for humans. </li><br>

        <li><b>High-Level Language:</b> High Level language are different from low-level languages in that it uses human 
        language as opposed to machine language. Some high-level programming include java, C++, Python, JavaScript and more. This code is than converted into machine code.</li>
        
        <h4>Types of language interpreters:</h4>
        <li><b>Assembler:</b> Converts assembly level program into machine level program.</li>
        <li><b>Interpreter:</b> Converts high level programs into machine level program line by line.</li>
        <li><b>Compiler:</b> Converts high level programs into machine level programs at one go rather than line by line.</li>

      <h3>Device Drivers</h3>
        <p class="TextStlye"><b>Device Drivers:</b> A device drivers’ main purpose is to control and manage functions for 
        specific devices on the computer. It lets the operating system communicate with specific hardware components. 
        For instance, an external device such as a printer will need a driver for the computer to control its functions. </p>

        <h2 class id="section7">Different Types of computers</h2>

        <p class="TextStyle"><b>Different Types of computers:</b> Computers can vary based on the development process and components. 
        For instance, some computers can be faster and have higher storage capacity and some are slow with smaller storage 
        capacities. When working with computers it is important to know what the classification of the computer. </p>

        <h3>Types of Computers</h3>

        <li><b>Desktop computer:</b>A desktop computer also called a person computer or PC is designed for use by one person
        in a fixed location. The desktop computer is an average computer that has a smaller storage capacity than more advanced 
        computer such as the supercomputer or mainframe computer. It generally has a CPU, monitor keyboard and mouse. </li><br>

        <li><b>Laptop:</b>A laptop computer is a small PC that is designed to be portable unlike the stationary desktop PC.
        A laptop has a similar design to any other computer expert that the internal computers are much smaller allowing the 
        shell of the computer to be smaller. The laptop generally has a screen, keyboard, and trackpad that functions the sane 
        way a mouse does. </li><br>

        <li><b>Workstation:</b>A workstation computer is similar in design to the desktop PC in that it is located in a fixed 
        location for use by one person. However, the workstation computer has a larger storage capacity and has a higher performance 
        than a basic desktop PC. It generally has a monitor, mouse and keyboard, improved graphics, and sound cards along with other 
        peripherals. </li><br>

        <li><b>Smartphone/Tablet:</b>As technology continues to advance the ability to create a smaller computer becomes easier. 
        With these advancements comes technology like the smartphone and tablet which are both miniature versions of computer devices. </li><br>

        <li><b>Mainframe computers:</b>Mainframe computers are an even more advanced version of workstation computers 
        because of its very large storage capacity and fast processing speeds. Mainframe computers are very expensive 
        and are often used by banks, railroads, insurance companies, and healthcare industries. </li><br>

        <li><b>Super computers:</b>Super computers are the fastest and most expensive computers on the plant. 
        They have a large capacity and have the fastest processing speed even surpassing the processing power of 
        the mainframe computers.  </li>

                  With online learning and self-learning becoming <br>the way of the future, 
                  it is crucial that incoming<br> students have an accurate and easy way to navigate<br>
                  resources that they can use throughout their learning<br> career. I am proposing the 
                  creation of a website to help<br> incoming computer science majors. This website will <br>
                  serve as a guide to teach and review a variety of <br>computer science topics and skills.
