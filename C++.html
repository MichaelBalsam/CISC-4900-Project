          <h2 class id="section1">Introduction to C++ Programming</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">C++ is a high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979. 
          The C++ programming language was created as an extension to the c programming language adding features such as 
          object-oriented programming. Today the C++ language can be considered a mid-level language that communicates close
          to the hardware layer while still being easier to program than low-level assembly languages. C++ can be found in a 
          variety of industries such as automobile, gaming, business, and various tech industries. </p>

          <h3>Why use C++?</h3>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">The C++ programming language is one of the more popular languages in the world. 
          Along with the java programming language C++ is often one of the first programming languages taught to 
          incoming computer science students. This is because of C++ allows you to learn programming from the ground 
          up. By having the user explain everything they do, which gives you a deeper understanding of how all the parts work.</p>

          <hr class="style">
  
          <h2 class id="section2">How to get started?</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">The C++ programming language can be easily accessed through a variety of platforms including Windows, 
          macOS, and Linux. Along with that C++ has a variety of integrated development environments (IDE) to choose from. 
          To find out more about which IDE best suits you visit:<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-5-ides-for-c-that-you-should-try-once/">Top 5 IDEs for C++</a></p>

          <h2 class id="section3">C++ Terminology</h2>

          <h3>List of C++ Terms</h3>

          <li><b>Class:</b> Is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. An example might be a “Customer” class. 
            The class can define attributes such as “name”, “customer number”, “address”. The class also defines behaviors (methods) 
            for objects created with the class. For instance, methods might be used to set the customer’s address, change the customer’s 
            address, and get the address.</li><br>
            
          <li><b>Objects:</b>An entity that has state and behavior; also known as an instance. For example: a bike that has 
            states (brand, # of gears, bicycle type) and behaviors (pedal, break, turn). It can be physical (bike, person) or logical 
            (date, checking account).</li><br>
  
            <li><b>Method:</b> Functions that belong to a class. They are used to operate on the internal state of an object and the 
              object-to-object communications.</li><br>

            <li><b>Function:</b>A sequence of statements. It has its own scope, accepts a set of argument values, and returns a value on completion.</li><br>

            <li><b>Local variable:</b>A variable that is defined inside a function.</li><br>

            <li><b>Global variable:</b>A variable that is defined outside of all the functions. </li><br>
    
            <li><b>Instance variable:</b> An instance variable is a variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks.</li><br>
    
            <li><b>Identifiers:</b> A programmer-defined name for a variable, method, class, or interface.</li><br>
    
            <li><b>Arrays:</b> A fixed-size object that can hold zero or more items of the array’s declared type.</li><br>
    
            <li><b>Access Modifiers:</b>Controls the access level. Some access modifiers include public, private, and protected. </li><br>
            
            <li><b>Non-Access Modifier:</b> Do not control access level but provides other functionality. 
            Some non-access modifiers include static, final, abstract, synchronized, volatile, transient, and native.</li><br>
    
            <li><b>Compile:</b> The action by a program (the compiler) of converting source code to a binary file that contains 
            the low-level instructions that the computer’s processor will execute.</li><br>
    
            <li><b>Iterate:</b> Iteration is when the same procedure is repeated multiple times</li><br>
    
            <li><b>Void:</b> A keyword that indicates a method does not return a value:</li>
  
          <hr class="style">
  
          <h2 class id="section4">C++ Data Types</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">Data type specifies the size and type of values that can be stored in an identifier. The C++ 
          language is rich in its data types. Different data types allow you to select the type appropriate to the needs of the 
          application. Data types can be split up into three main categories: primitive, derived, and user defined data types.</p>
  
          <h3>Data types of classification:</h3>

            <li><b>Primitive data types</b></li>
              <ul>

                <li>Always have a value.</li>
                <li>Start with a lower-case letter.</li>
                <li>The size of the primitive types is determined by data types itself.</li>
                <li>There are seven different primitive types in C++: Boolean, char, double, float, int, void, and wchar_t.</li>

          <h2 class id="section5">Basic Syntax</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">The syntax of C++ refers to the set of rules defining how a C++ program is written and interpreted. 
          It is important that syntax is correct as to prevent any errors in the code. </p>
  
          <h3>List of syntax rules</h3>
  
          <li><b>Case sensitivity:</b> The C++ programming language is case sensitive. This means that identifiers with different 
          cases such as Apple and apple would have different meanings.</li> <br>

          <li><b>Class names:</b>Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of
          each internal word capitalized. Try to keep your class names simple and
          descriptive.</li><br>

          <li><b>Function:</b>A sequence of statements. It has its own scope, accepts a set of
          argument values, and returns a value on completion.</li><br>

          <li><b>Methods:</b> Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase, with the 
          first letter of each internal word capitalized.</li> <br>

          <li><b>Variables:</b> The variable names should not start with a dollar (‘$’) or underscore(‘_’). 
          One character variable name must be avoided and should be mnemonic. </li> <br>

          <li><b>Comments:</b> Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. 
          It can also be used to prevent execution when testing an alternative code.</li><br>

          <li><b>Constant variables:</b> The name of a constant variable must have all the letters capital 
          and if it has more words at name should be separated by an underscore (‘_’). </li><br>

          <li><b>Semicolons:</b> The semicolon (‘;’) is a character that we see almost at every line of code. 
          It shows the compiler where an instruction ends and where the next instruction begins. Some statements 
          have a special characteristic which is that they are self-close. </li><br>
          
         <li><b>Brackets, Braces, parentheses:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Brackets are used to index into an array.</li><br>

              <li>Braces are used for three purposes: 1) To group statements and declarations. 
              The contents of a class or interface are enclosed in braces. 2) Is for 
              enclosing methods, and constructor bodies are enclosed in braces. 3) Is to group 
              the statements in an if statement, a loop, or other control structures.</li><br>

              <li>Parentheses are used for two purposes: 1) to control the order of operations 
              in an expression, 2) Is used to supply parameters to a constructor or method.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
 
          <hr class="style">
  
          <h2 class id="section6">Control Statements</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">A control statement is a statement in C++ that determines whether the other statements will be 
          executed or not. It can also be referred to as a decision-making statements, looping statements, branching statement. 
          The purpose of the control statement is to control the flow of the program. </p>
  
          <h3>List of control statements:</h3>
  
          <li><b>If statement:</b> The if statement is used to specify whether a block of code will be executed, 
          if the statement is true the code block will execute.</li><br>

          <li><b>If-else statement:</b> The if-else statement is used to specify whether a block of code will be executed, 
          if the statement is true the code will execute otherwise the else block will execute.</li><br>
  
          <li><b>Nested if statement:</b> The nested if-else statement is similar to an if statement. However, 
          a nested if statement executes one condition from multiple statements.</li> <br>

          <li><b>Switch statement:</b> The switch statement is used to execute a block of code depending on different cases.</li> <br>

          <li><b>For loop:</b> The for loop statement is used to execute a sequence of statements multiple times. 
          A for loop is useful when you know how many times a task is to be repeated.</li> <br>

          <li><b>While loop:</b> The While loop statement is used to repeat a statement or group of statements while a given 
          condition is true. It tests the condition <b>before</b> executing the loop body.</li> <br>

          <li><b>Do-while loop:</b> The do-while loop statement is similar to a while loop statement, 
          except that it tests the condition at the <b>end</b> of the loop body.</li> <br>

          <li><b>Break statement:</b> The break statement is used to end the loop or switch statement. </li> <br>

          <li><b>Continue statement:</b> The continue statement is used to break one iteration (in the loop), 
          if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.</li> <br>
  
          <hr class="style">

          <h2 class id="section7">Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
          <p class="TextStyle">Object-Oriented programming OOP is a programming
          paradigm that revolves around the concept of classes and objects. OOP is based around 4
          core principles: polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.</p>

          <h4>Four principles of OOP:</h4>

          <li><b>Polymorphism:</b> Polymorphisms means having many forms. In java subclasses of a class can define their 
          own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class. For example, 
          a class called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses of Animals could be Cats, Dogs.
          They also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the dog barks, and the cat meows).</li><br>

          <li><b>Inheritance:</b> Inheritance is when one class is able to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. 
          There are two keywords to know when it comes to inheritance subclass (child) and superclass (parent). One example of 
          inheritance is a class called Car (subclass) inheriting the features of a class called vehicle (superclass).</li><br>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Subclass</b> (child): The class that inherits features from another class is called a subclass. </li><br>

              <li><b>Superclass</b> (parent): The class that’s features are being inherited from. </li>

          <li><b>Encapsulation:</b> Encapsulation is when the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes and can be 
          accessed only through the methods of their current class.</li><br>

          <li><b>Abstraction:</b> Abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential 
          information to the user. Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces:
          Abstract class: An abstract class is a restricted class that cannot be used to
          create objects in order to access it, it must be inherited from another class.
          Abstract method: An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class,
          and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass it is
          inherited from. </li><br>

                    With online learning and self-learning becoming <br>the way of the future, 
                    it is crucial that incoming<br> students have an accurate and easy way to navigate<br>
                    resources that they can use throughout their learning<br> career. I am proposing the 
                    creation of a website to help<br> incoming computer science majors. This website will <br>
                    serve as a guide to teach and review a variety of <br>computer science topics and skills.
