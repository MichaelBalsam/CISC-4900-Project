          <p class="TextStyle">MySQL is often referred to as the most used Open-Source Relational SQL database management system or (RDBMS).
          MySQL was developed in the mid-90s by Michael Widenius, David Axmark and Allan Larsson. The name MySQL comes from a combination 
          of "My", the name the primary developer Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", which stands for Structured Query Language. MySQL 
          was written in C and C++ and can work with a variety of platforms such as Windows, MacOS, Unix, and Linux to name a few. In order 
          to fully understand MySQL, the user needs to have an understanding of databases, RDBMS, and SQL. </p>
  
          <p>This short video goes into more detail of how and why it was developed:

          <h2 class id="section3">What is a Database?</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">A database is an organized collection of data that is stored on 
          a computer system. Every database has at least one or more APIs (Application Programming Interface) that allow 
          the user to create, access, manage, search, and replicate the data being stored in it. Databases are used all over 
          the world in a variety of different places like in hospitals, banks, and schools. </p>

          <h3>Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS)</h3>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS): These days we use something called 
          relational database management systems RDBMS to store and manage large quantities of data. RDBMS is given its 
          name because of the way the data is stored in the software. Each piece of data is grouped into separate tables 
          that have relations which are created using something called primary and foreign keys. </p>
  
          <h3>Relational DataBase Management System Vocabulary:</h3>

          <li><b>Database:</b> A Database is an organized collection of data stored grouped into tables and stored on a computer system. </li><br>
          <li><b>Tables:</b> A table is a collection of related data held in a table format within a database.  
          Each table consists of rows and columns similar to the design of a spreadsheet.</li><br>
          <li><b>Row:</b> A row is a collection related data, for instance all the data for one specific customer. 
          A row is sometimes to a tuple or record. </li><br>
          <li><b>Columns:</b> A column is a collection of data of the same type, for instance a phone number. </li><br>
          <li><b>Primary Key:</b> A primary key is used to uniquely identify an entry in a table. </li><br>
          <li><b>Foreign Key:</b> A foreign key is used to establish a link or relationship between two different tables.</li><br>
          <li><b>Composite Key:</b> A composite key is a key that can be selected as a primary key of the table. </li><br>
          <li><b>Alternate key:</b> Alternate keys are the remaining candidate keys, not currently selected as a primary key of the table. </li><br>
          <li><b>Composite key:</b> A composite key is a group of two or more columns that identifies each row of a table uniquely.</li><br>
          <li><b>Unique Key:</b> A unique key is similar to a primary key and does not allow duplicates in the column </li><br>
          <li><b>Super Key:</b> A super key is a set of columns on which all columns of the table are functionally dependent. 
          It is a set of columns that uniquely identify each row in a table. </li><br>
          <li><b>Referential Integrity:</b> Referential Integrity makes sure that a foreign key value always points to an existing row.</li><br>
          <li><b>Index:</b> An index is a quick way of locating data that is stored within the database.</li>

          <p>The figure below represents the basic view of a database table:</p>

          <h2 class id="section5">MySQL/SQL Commands</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">In order to store, retrieve, modify, and manage a database the user must learn SQL commands. 
          These commands can be split up into four categories: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Query Language (DQL), 
          Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).</p>
  
          <h4>Examples of DDL commands:</h4>
          <p class="TextStyle">Data Definition Language: DDL refers to the set of SQL commands that can create and manipulate
          the structure of the database. </p>
          <li><b>Create table:</b> The create table statement is used to create a table in a database organized into rows and columns.</li><br>
          <li><b>Alter table:</b> The alter table statement is used to add, remove, delete, or modify columns in an existing table. </li><br>
          <li><b>Drop table:</b> The drop table statement is used to remove a table definition and all the data, indexes, triggers, 
          constraints, and permission specifications for that table.  </li><br>
          <li><b>Truncate table:</b> Truncate table delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself.</li><br>

  
          <h4>Examples of DML commands:</h4>
          <p class="TextStyle">Data Manipulation Language: DML deals with data manipulation and 
          includes the most common SQL statements. </p>
          <li><b>Insert:</b>The insert into statement is used to add a new record to a table.</li><br>
          <li><b>Delete:</b>The delete from statement is used to delete rows from a table.</li><br>
          <li><b>Update:</b>The update where statement is used to update or modify data in an existing table. </li><br>

          <h4>Examples of DQL commands:</h4>
          <p class="TextStyle">Data Query Language: DQL is used as a way to perform a query on the data within 
          schema objects. A schema object is a logical structure created by the users. </p>
          <li><b>Select:</b>The select statement is used to retrieve information from the database.</li><br>

          <h4>Examples of DCL commands:</h4>
          <p class="TextStyle">Data Control Language: DCL is used to control access to data stored in a database.</p>
          <li><b>Grant:</b>The grant command gives user’s access privileges to the database.</li><br>
          <li><b>Revoke</b>The revoke command withdraws the user’s access privileges given by using the grant command.</li><br>
