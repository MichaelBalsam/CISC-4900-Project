          <p class="TextStyle">Introduction to Java Programming: Java is a high-level object-oriented programming language 
          developed in the early 90s by James Gosling. The java programming language was called OAK. OAK was originally developed
          for interactive televisions; however, the project was later redesigned to become what it is today. Nowadays Java is known 
          as the most popular programming language and is used for things such as internet programming, mobile devices, games, and 
          e-business solutions. </p>

          <h3>Why use Java?</h3>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">Java is one of the most popular programming languages and platforms in the world and is 
          often the first programming language taught to new computer science students. This is because java was built on one core idea, 
          the ability to “Write Once, Run Anywhere”. This means that java can be written on one system and run on all available operating 
          systems that support java, giving the developer the ability to work on multiple platforms. </p>
          
          <p>The video below explains the Key Features of Java:</p>

          <hr class="style">
  
          <h2 class id="section2">How to get started?</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">The java programming language can be easily accessed through a variety of platforms including Windows, 
          macOS, and Linux. Along with that java has a variety of integrated development environments (IDE) to choose from. 
          To find out more about which IDE best suits you visit:<a href="https://www.guru99.com/best-java-ide.html"> List of Java IDE.</a></p>
  
          <h4>Steps to installing java:</h4>
          
          <li>Step 1: Visit:<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html">JDK download</a> to download the java development 
          kit or JDK. JDK is a key platform component for building java applications. It includes things such as 
          the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), 
          a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.</li><br>

          <li>Step 2: Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the download that meets the requirements of the system. 
          For instance, for Windows x64 bit operating system, select the Windows x64 bit installer and begin the download. 
          For macOS, select the macOS installer. Follow the installation instructions until it is complete. </li><br>

          <li>Step 3: Find an IDE that best suits you and begin downloading it.</li>
  
          <h4>To help get started here are some easy-to-use and completly free IDEs:</h4>

          <h2 class id="section3">Java Terminology</h2>
  
          <h3>List of Java Terms</h3>
  
          <li><b>Class:</b> A blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. An example might be a “Customer” class. 
          The class can define attributes such as “name”, “customer number”, “address”. The class also defines behaviors (methods) 
          for objects created with the class. For instance, methods might be used to set the customer’s address, change the customer’s 
          address, and get the address.</li><br>
        
          <li><b>Objects:</b>An entity that has state and behavior also known as an instance. For example a bike that has 
          states (brand, # of gears, bicycle type) and behaviors (pedal, break, turn). It can be physical (bike, person) or logical 
          (date, checking account).</li><br>

          <li><b>Method:</b> Functions that belong to a class. They are used to operate on the internal state of an object and the 
          object-to-object communications.</li><br>

          <li><b>Instance variable:</b>A variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks.</li><br>

          <li><b>Identifiers:</b> A programmer-defined name for a variable, method, class, or interface.</li><br>

          <li><b>Arrays:</b> A fixed-size object that can hold zero or more items of the array’s declared type.</li><br>

          <li><b>Access Modifiers:</b>Controls the access level. Some access modifiers include public, private, and protected. </li><br>

          <li><b>Public</b> Is a Java keyword which declares a member's access as public. Public members are visible to all other classes.</li><br>

          <li><b>Private:</b>Is an access modifier used for attributes, methods, and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>Protected:</b> Is an access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>Non-Access Modifier:</b>Do not control access level but provides other functionality. 
          Some non-access modifiers include static, final, abstract, synchronized, volatile, transient, and native.</li><br>

          <li><b>Compile:</b> The action by a program (the compiler) of converting source code to a binary file that contains 
          the low-level instructions that the computer’s processor will execute.</li><br>

          <li><b>Iterate:</b> Iteration is when the same procedure is repeated multiple times</li><br>

          <li><b>Void:</b> A keyword that indicates a method does not return a value:</li>

          <h2 class id="section4">Java Data Types</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">Specifies the size and type of values that can be stored in an identifier. 
          The Java language is rich in its data types. Different data types allow you to select the type appropriate to 
          the needs of the application. Data types can be split up into two main categories primitive and non-primitive data types.</p>
  
          <h3>Data types of classification:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Primitive data types</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Are predefined in the java.</li>
                <li>Always have a value.</li>
                <li>Start with a lower-case letter.</li>
                <li>The size of the primitive types is determined by data types itself.</li>
                <li>There are eight different primitive types in java: Boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long and short.</li>
              </ul><br>

          <p><b>Sting type:</b> This data type is used to store consecutive characters. Strings are treated as objects.</p>
          <p><b>Arrays</b> This is a data type used to store data in a consecutive manner. 
          It can store any type of data as the size of the array is also declared by the programmer. </p>
          <p><b>Classes:</b> A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  
          It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. </p>
          <p><b>Interface:</b> An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies. </p>

          <h2 class id="section5">Basic Syntax</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">The syntax of Java refers to the set of rules defining how a Java program is written and interpreted. 
          It is important that syntax is correct as to prevent any errors in the code. </p>
  
          <h3>List of syntax rules</h3>
  
          <li><b>Case sensitivity:</b> The java programming language is case sensitive. This means that identifiers with different 
          cases such as Apple and apple would have different meanings.</li> <br>

          <li><b>Methods:</b> Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase, with the 
          first letter of each internal word capitalized.</li> <br>

          <li><b>Variables:</b> The variable names should not start with a dollar (‘$’) or underscore(‘_’). 
          One character variable name must be avoided and should be mnemonic. </li> <br>

          <li><b>Comments:</b> Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. 
          It can also be used to prevent execution when testing an alternative code.</li><br>

          <li><b>Constant variables:</b> The name of a constant variable must have all the letters capital 
          and if it has more words at name should be separated by an underscore (‘_’). </li><br>

          <li><b>Semicolons:</b> The semicolon (‘;’) is a character that we see almost at every line of code. 
          It shows the compiler where an instruction ends and where the next instruction begins. Some statements 
          have a special characteristic which is that they are self-close. </li><br>
          
         <li><b>Brackets, Braces, parentheses:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Brackets are used to index into an array.</li><br>

              <li>Braces are used for three purposes: one to group statements and declarations. 
              The contents of a class or interface are enclosed in braces. The second is for 
              enclosing methods, and constructor bodies are enclosed in braces. The third is to group 
              the statements in an if statement, a loop, or other control structures.</li><br>

              <li>Parentheses are used for two purposes: one is to control the order of operations 
              in an expression and second use is to supply parameters to a constructor or method.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
 
          <hr class="style">
  
          <h2 class id="section6">Control Statements</h2>
  
          <p class="TextStyle">A control statement is a statement in java that determines whether the other statements will be 
          executed or not. It can also be referred to as a decision-making statements, looping statements, or branching statement. 
          The purpose of the control statement is to control the flow of the program. </p>
  
          <h3>List of control statements:</h3>
  
          <li><b>If statement:</b> The if statement is used to specify whether a block of code will be executed, 
          if the statement is true the code block will execute.</li><br>

          <li><b>If-else statement:</b> The if-else statement is used to specify whether a block of code will be executed, 
          if the statement is true the code will execute otherwise the else block will execute.</li><br>
  
          <li><b>Nested if statement:</b> The nested if-else statement is similar to an if statement. However, 
          a nested if statement executes one condition from multiple statements.</li> <br>

          <li><b>Switch statement:</b> The switch statement is used to execute a block of code depending on different cases.</li> <br>

          <li><b>For loop:</b> The for loop statement is used to execute a sequence of statements multiple times. 
          A for loop is useful when you know how many times a task is to be repeated.</li> <br>

          <li><b>While loop:</b> The While loop statement is used to repeat a statement or group of statements while a given 
          condition is true. It tests the condition <b>before</b> executing the loop body.</li> <br>

          <li><b>Do-while loop:</b> The do-while loop statement is similar to a while loop statement, 
          except it tests the condition at the <b>end</b> of the loop body.</li> <br>

          <li><b>Break statement:</b> The break statement is used to end the loop or switch statement. </li> <br>

          <li><b>Continue statement:</b> The continue statement is used to break one iteration (in the loop), 
          if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.</li> <br>

          <h2 class id="section7">Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
          <p class="TextStyle">Object-Oriented programming OOP is a programming
          paradigm that revolves around the concept of classes and objects. OOP is based around 4
          core principles: polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.</p>

          <h4>Four principles of OOP:</h4>

          <li><b>Polymorphism:</b> Polymorphisms means having many forms. In java subclasses of a class can define their 
          own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class. For example, 
          a class called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses of Animals could be Cats, Dogs.
          They also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the dog barks, and the cat meows).</li><br>

          <li><b>Inheritance:</b> Inheritance is when one class is able to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. 
          There are two keywords to know when it comes to inheritance subclass (child) and superclass (parent). One example of 
          inheritance is a class called Car (subclass) inheriting the features of a class called vehicle (superclass).</li><br>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Subclass</b> (child): The class that inherits features from another class is called a subclass. </li><br>

              <li><b>Superclass</b> (parent): The class that’s features are being inherited from. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

          <li><b>Encapsulation:</b> Encapsulation is when the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes and can be 
          accessed only through the methods of their current class.</li><br>

                    With online learning and self-learning becoming <br>the way of the future, 
                    it is crucial that incoming<br> students have an accurate and easy way to navigate<br>
                    resources that they can use throughout their learning<br> career. I am proposing the 
                    creation of a website to help<br> incoming computer science majors. This website will <br>
                    serve as a guide to teach and review a variety of <br>computer science topics and skills.
